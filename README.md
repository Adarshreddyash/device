**Box-shadows Device (BSD)** is a tool for creating simple and beautiful devices on your website. Created your device, edit the colors, background and add to it buttons. You can use the created devices to demonstrate your code, templates, pictures, adaptive design and much more.

## Device
Select one of the five available devices
* phone-small
* phone-big
* tablet-portrait
* tablet-landscape
* ipod

## Background
Add a black, white or transparent background. 
You have the opportunity to create your own background! To do this,
* click on the circle near the button `‚Üê Choose`
* create your own color or enter the color code in the appeared window
* click to `Enter`

You can set the color values yourself. When the code is received, the values are reflected in the RGB format. If you need a hexadecimal representation, your HEX code will appear next to you. Click on it and copy. If you do not see the color code after activating the "Get code" button, try changing it again.

## Box-shadow
You can add a shadow to your device. Now there are 5 types available:
* bSd_light
* bSd_small
* bSd_big
* bSd_classic
* bSd_none

## Display

You can easily add and change the styles of your device.

## Buttons
When creating a device, you can add and remove interface buttons. Click the buttons one by one or turn them off or click all to create a suitable interface.
*At the moment they are not displayed in the code, but we will try to fix this in the near future.*

You can set the relative or absolute position

## Create your own style
You can enter any attribute and its contents. To save multiple attributes, separate them with a semicolon.
